    <h1>Egusi Soup</h1>

    <p>
        Egusi soup is native to West Africa, and many of my American and Nigerian friends enjoy this recipe when I make it. <br />
        Ground egusi seeds give the soup a unique flavor. It's a delicious and hearty soup for those who like to try something <br /> 
        different every once in a while.

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
        If you can't find egusi seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds.<br />
        Any combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked fish can be used in place of the shrimp.<br />
        Drained, smoked oysters and chicken can be used in place of the beef.
